# PDF Merger

This Python script merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF document. It utilizes the `PyPDF2` library to achieve this functionality.

## Usage

1. Place this script in the same directory as your `.pdf` files.
2. Run the script using Python (e.g., `pdfMerger.py`).
3. The merged PDF file will be saved as `merged.pdf` in the same directory.

## Notes

- Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
- Make sure to install the dependencies `from requirements.txt` file.
- Modify the script if you need additional functionality or want to customize the behavior.
