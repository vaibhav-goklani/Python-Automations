# Unzip Files Script

This Python script automates the process of unzipping files in the current directory. It identifies files with the `.zip` extension, extracts their contents, and removes the original `.zip` files.

## Usage

1. Place this script in the same directory as your `.zip` files.
2. Run the script using Python (e.g., `python unzip.py`).
3. The extracted files will be available in the same directory.

## Notes

- Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
- Make sure to install the dependencies `from requirements.txt` file.
- Modify the script if you need additional functionality or want to customize the behavior.
